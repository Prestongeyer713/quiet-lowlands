This project utilizes. mysql and dotenv packages to mess around with apis.
to load up run npm init, then npm run seed. once youve done those two just type npm start.
once the application is running you can use multiple third party programs to navigate your database and api.
today i used insomnia. in insomnia you can create, get and delete objects using json.
unfortunatly i wasnt able to figure out how to get the update function to work so i left it out for this project.
Once i understand more about code I hope to not run into this problem again.
below i have a demo gif to demonstrate my apps functionality.
